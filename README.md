## Project Goals:
- Gain practical experience with a NoSQL system data management system and communicate what we learned.
- Utilize MongoDB (Azure Cosmos DB) as the main data storage solution and query the same MongoDB database using PySpark, within Databricks.
- Establish connectivity using the MongoDB-PySpark connector to facilitate seamless integration between MongoDB and PySpark.
- Directly query data from MongoDB, using PyMongo, and conduct performance testing of the queries executed in both Spark and PyMongo.
